# Illustration of different effects in the correlation of solar and ionosphere parameters in time scales of several days to months

## Abstract 
The activities of the Sun have a significant impact on the ionosphere and its variations. Solar irradiance, approximated by F10.7 solar flux index, drives the ionization processes, increasing the electron density in the ionosphere. Solar wind deposits energy in the high-latitude ionosphere through convection electric and Joule heating. This study investigates different effects in the correlation of solar and ionosphere parameters in time scales of several days to months. It inspects the temporal, latitudinal and local time dependency of the correlation analysis between total electron content in the ionosphere against F10.7 solar flux and solar wind speed from 1998 to 2020 using Pearson correlation coefficient with a window size of 90 days. The correlation analysis is performed on the relative differences of the parameters (ΔF10.7rel , ΔVSWrel , ΔTECrel). The result shows, at low latitudes, there is a significant positive correlation between ΔTECrel and ΔF10.7rel , but as latitude increases, the correlation decreases. F10.7 solar flux and total electron content are positively correlated across all regions and seasons. Total electron content and F10.7 solar flux have no distinguishable pattern of seasonal correlation. However, the degree of positive correlation between summer and winter fluctuates slightly. The correlation between TEC and F10.7 solar flux is highest during daytime hours than nightime hours and the local time dependency is most pronounced in the equatorial region. Results of correlation between ΔTECrel and ΔVSWrel shows positive correlation at the low latitude region during solar minimum conditions and at high latitude regions there it shows a significant negative correlation. In contrast to correlation between F10.7 solar flux, solar wind speed correlation with TEC shows strong seasonal dependency. Changes in electric fields caused by variations in the solar wind speed areassumed to modify the plasma transport in the ionosphere and thus modifyTEC. These dependencies of TEC on solar wind in the range of days needs deeper investigation to understand the coupling processes and quantify the impact.
